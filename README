Dataset construction

Go to Code folder
 
Run 

python root_to_pkl.py

This constructs datasets in Data folder in pickle format.

Training

Run

python main_ttH.py -u 2.0 -d_mode all -e 300

Here -u corresponds to discriminator importance paremeter. -d_mode specifies which strategy for feeding descriminator to use
"all" - both signal/bkg passed, "bkg_only" - background only. You can also run by default parameters

python main_ttH.py

Evaluation

To plot response, training curves or ROC curve for default training run one of these

python plot_response.py
python plot_train_val_loss.py
python roc_curve.py

To plot the results of not default setting specify the same arguments as you used in training, for example:

python main_ttH.py -u 2.0 -d_mode all -e 300
python plot_response.py -u 2.0 -d_mode all -e 300
python plot_train_val_loss.py -u 2.0 -d_mode all -e 300
python roc_curve.py -u 2.0 -d_mode all -e 300

Be careful with new parameters like -d_mode, because they are not listed in the stored file names yet.
You can also try to make a scan on any parameters or force to plot all the curves after training by running 

python mu_scan.py

However, you will need to specify the parameters yourself editing mu_scan.py, only a minimal example is left in the final version. 

Save results

All the Plots are saved in the corresponding folder. The most important info about each run is stored in the Results/mu_accuracy.csv
